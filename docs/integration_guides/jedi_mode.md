Jedi mode means users can turn their gestures into target motions, like a jedi.

Gesture mapping page lists all the gestures available in jedi mode.
A couple special gestures need extra explanation:

- stop: put your hands on your knees while standing. This sets MotionPlayer to off mode (no signal will be sent). Also do this when you want to stop motion playback immediately.
- wave: wave with your right hand. This sets MotionPlayer to event mode (gesture mode).
- both arms out: raise both arms aside to the height of your shoulder. This sets MotionPlayer to live mode (follower mode). In this mode, the car follows the positions of your hand.

These gestures' original mapped motions will not be played. You can edit the mode switch gestures in `jedi_config.json`.

Instructions for some other gestures:

- jump: squat and then stand up with your hands up high. Keep raising your hands until it is recognized.
- heart: make a heart with your arms around your head.

Jedi Mode also supports hand gestures.

- Make sure the mode is event mode
- Click on the leftmost dropdown on top of the camera. Set pose detection to hand detection.

Face detection is not supported.
